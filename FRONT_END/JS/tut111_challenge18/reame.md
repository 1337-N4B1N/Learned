You have to use an apu and dusplay the data in the form of a card under a container. All the data points returned by the api should be converted to card..

Use this api
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts


Create navbar...create container...inside container there shall be cards..card shall display user id,id,title and body....

HINT:
at first state will be empty..
Create a state for the data whcih will be fethed using the jsonplaceholder API

 Inside useEffect,use fetch to populate that state and then use map to render the cards from the state
