  # Why React?

   - We can use states which means that once we update the variable,it changes across the page
   - It is library of JS.
   - We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
   - React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better  than updating content using DOM Manipulation
   - Debbugin and maintainance is easy

  # Installation of react
